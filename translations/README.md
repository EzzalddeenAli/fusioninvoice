# FusionInvoice translations

These translation are taken from https://github.com/FusionInvoice/translations.
I put the newly open sourced FusionInvoice under the Apache 2.0 license. If there
is a problem to put the translations under the same license, let me know and I'm sure
we will find the right license which works for everyone.

Please note that translations you can download here are community-driven and are free to use.

## How to use

1. [Download](https://github.com/FusionInvoice/translations/archive/master.zip) the latest translations package
2. Unzip the translation(s) folder(s) you need
3. Upload them to your FusionInvoice project in the `/resources/lang` folder
